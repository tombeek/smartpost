# smartpost
=========

**smartpost** is a Perl based XML parsing and publishing solution.
 My intention in creating this project was to create a simple, web-based interface for accepting XML files and parsing them into *possibly several* webpages based on the contents.

I was impressed by the number of public libraries available in the Perl community for doing things like building HTML pages, and parsing XML.
