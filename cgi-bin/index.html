Just a quick note to let you know we were very pleased with the experience we had using your service. The opportunity to pre-screen applicants that answered some preliminary questions helped us wade through hundreds of applicants in a fraction of the time it would have taken in a traditional process. In the end, we identified a number of potential candidates more quickly, and were able to fill the open sales position with significantly less effort than we were used to - great job building a better mousetrap.

We have tried everything from national job boards to regional job boards to newspapers and recruiters. I have found BulletHire (owns AutoSalesReps.com) to be the quickest, most cost efficient way to get better qualified applicants,....period. The built-in screening process allows us to quickly discover which applicants might be the best fit for our company. We no longer waste time & money attempting (by trial and error) to produce the "perfect ad". The bottom line is that BulletHire produces results that are faster and far superior than anything else we've tried!

Michael Alfheim, Sales Manager, California
BulletHire (owns AutoSalesReps.com) delivered what they promised...a pool of qualified sales reps. The first time I used the service within days I had over a dozen qualified candidates. It was reassuring to know they had already been prescreened, which saved me a lot of time! Through interviews, I found four candidates that were competitively very close and narrowed my search successfully. BulletHire worked well for my company, and I have just initiated a new search with them for two more new reps. As recruiting goes, I would recommend them to any of my peers.
Allen Brooks, President, New Jersey
I wanted to take this opportunity to commend BulletHire (owns AutoSalesReps.com) on the service they provide to companies looking to fill positions. Whenever we have a  job opening to fill, we contact  BulletHire to alert them of our need. Once the job specifications are provided, we receive resumes from qualified applicants immediately. I would strongly recommend BulletHire to anyone looking to fill staffing requirements due to their professionalism, follow-up, assistance and providing of highly qualified applicants to fill those requirements.
